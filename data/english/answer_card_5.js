		text: 'Back in the United States, Ellen White settled near the town of St. Helena in California. She named her home Elmshaven. She encouraged the General Conference and the local conferences to reorganize so that they could do better work for God. She also wanted Adventists not to huddle all together at Battle Creek but to move to different places so that they could witness for God. She encouraged the Review and Herald Publishing Association as well as the General Conference offices to move to Maryland on the East Coast. At the age of 81 Ellen White attended her last General Conference session in 1909. At the conference she spoke a number of times in a clear, firm voice. At the end of her last talk, she held out a Bible, saying, "Brethren and sisters, I commend to you this book!".'

On the morning of February 13, 1915, as she was entering her study, she tripped and fell, and broke her hip.  She couldn\'t walk anymore and gradually grew weaker. During the last months of her life her words to friends and relatives were cheerful. She knew that she had done her best to be faithful as Godâ€™s messenger. Her last words were, "I know in whom I have believed."'
