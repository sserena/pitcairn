		text: 'Ellen and her twin sister, Elizabeth, were born to Robert and Eunice Harmon, November 26 in 1827, in the little town of Gorham, Maine. There were 8 children in the family. Their father, Robert Harmon was a hat maker. After the family moved to Portland, Maine, an awful thing happened to Ellen. One day she and her twin sister were on their way home when an older girl threw a rock that hit Ellen\'s nose. She was badly hurt. She was very sick for many days. Her dad was away at the time. When he came home Ellen\'s looks had changed so much that he didn\'t even know her. She was heartbroken  but, she learned that Jesus still loved her and would always love her. She liked to tell her friends about Jesus, and pray for them. At the age of 12 she was baptized. Ellen and her family heard William Miller preach and believed that Jesus was coming back on October 22, 1844. Because of this her family were dismissed from their Methodist Church. Ellen was serious about helping her friends prepare for Jesus\' coming. She even knitted socks to raise money to donate for pamphlets to be printed about Jesus soon return.'

		text: 'They were so very sad when Jesus didn\'t come. It was only a little while after the "Great Disappointment" that God gave Ellen her first vision. She was just 17 years old. This would be the first of about 2,000 visions she would receive during her lifetime. In this vision she saw the journey of the Adventist people to the New Jerusalem. She felt that Jesus understood how sad they all were, that He still loved them, and that they would soon understand that He really is coming. He wanted her to tell all of His people, but she didn\'t want to do that â€“ she was afraid! She finally agreed to try to tell others about her visions. Ellen wasn\'t very well, sometimes she could hardly talk, but when she began to tell about her visions her voice always came back, and was strong. Until her death in 1915, Ellen was God\'s special Messenger to His special people.'
